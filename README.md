# indexify
Simple tool that creates an index.html of all files in a directory.

## Install
Just **go install** the repository as of now. Prebuilt binaries coming on later.

## Usage
Just open a terminal, **cd** into any directory and call **indexify** *(be sure it is on your PATH)*. This will create an **index.html** file on the current directory listing **size**, **name**, and **last modified** on a table and links to those files/folders.

## To Do

* Polish default template with css/icons and js sorting. *(single index.html file with embedded/cdn imports)*
* Recursive *index.html* generation.
* Command line support for more flexibility and options.
* Configuration file *(probably ~/.indexify)*
* Target directory
* Custom templates
* Deployment? *(at least S3 capable in the future)*
